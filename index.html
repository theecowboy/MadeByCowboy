      <h3>Digital Art</h3>
      <p>I have been creating digital art for a short period of time and have done logo designs alongside my own original work. The arduous process of creation brings me so much joy!</p>

      <h3>Rug Tufting</h3>
      <p>There are several ways to bring a work of art to fruition and rug tufting is one of them. Fiber-art is one of them. Bringing a unique dimension to any piece of art whether that be with a statement rug to bring any room together or a wall piece that adds texture to any space. Not to mention the countless other ways fiber-art can be utilized!</p>

      <h3>Web Development</h3>
      <a href="https://www.freepik.com">by Freepik</a>
      <p>Not only do I have a firm grasp on the fundamentals that go into Front-End Development, but I also truly enjoy the quest for solution and understanding. Programming feels like working on a grand puzzle and finally finding that debug solution is like the moment the last puzzle piece falls into place. Truly triumphant.</p>

      <h3>Adaptability</h3>
      <a href="https://creativemarket.com/eucalyp">by Eucalyp</a>
      <p>Knowledge is power and the pursuit of knowledge is one of the greatest priviledges of life. I love being presented with a new problem because that means I get to participate in the rewarding (and oftentimes very fun) process of problem-solving. Coming across a problem beyond my current knowledge and getting to discover and pick up new skills is one of my personal favorite hobbies. That means I get to go down the rabbithole of asking more and more quesitons until I finally chase down the solution. </p>
